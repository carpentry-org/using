# using

Context managers for Carp. An experiment.

## Installation

You can include `using` in your project like this:

```clojure
(load git@github.com:carpentry-org/using@0.0.2")
```

## Usage

`using` relies on the interface `close`, which will take in a resource of some
kind, clean it up, and return the result of the expression.

If that function is defined, you can do things like that:

```clojure
(println*
  &(using (Result.unsafe-from-success (File.open "example")) f
    &(File.read-all &f)))
```

The file that was opened will be automatically closed once the scope is exited.

So, to reiterate: all you need to work with `using` is to have a function
`close` that works on your type! Itâ€™s like manual borrow-checking for resource
things! Nifty, eh?

And if you need to support multiple forms, `using-do` is your friend!

Have fun!
